## What is KubeClipper?

KubeClipper aims to provide easy-to-use, easy-to-operate, lightweight, product-grade kubernetes multi-cluster full lifecycle management service, freeing operation and maintenance engineers from complicated configuration and obscure command lines to achieve one-stop management of multi-K8 s clusters across regions and infrastructure.

## Why do I want KubeClipper?

In the cloud-native era, Kubernetes has undoubtedly become the de facto standard for container orchestration. Although there are many tools to assist in the installation and management of K8S clusters, it is still very complicated to build and operate a production-level K8S cluster. In the process of a large number of services and practices, 99cloud has precipitated an extremely lightweight and easy-to-use graphical interface Kubernetes multi-cluster management tool - KubeClipper.

Under the premise of being fully compatible with native Kubernetes, KubeClipper is repackaged based on the kubeadm tool widely used by the community, providing rapid deployment of K8S clusters and continuous full life cycle management (installation, uninstallation, upgrade, scaling) in the enterprise's own infrastructure. It supports multiple deployment methods such as online, proxy, and offline, and also provides rich and scalable management services for CRI, CNI, CSI, and various CRD components.

Compared with the existing K8S lifecycle management tools such as Sealos, KubeKey, Kubeasz, KubeOperator, and K0S, KubeClipper is more open and native, lightweight, convenient, stable and easy to use.
