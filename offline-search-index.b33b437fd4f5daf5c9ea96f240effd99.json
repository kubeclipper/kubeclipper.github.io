When adding a node, a physical or logical region can be specified for the node. The K8S cluster created by the node under this area also belongs to this region. Creating a cluster using multiple regional nodes is not supported.\nControl Nodes: Specify an odd number of control nodes for the cluster. The production environments generally use 3 control nodes to achieve high availability.\nWorker nodes: Add worker nodes to the new cluster according to the business size.\nTaint management: You can configure taint for added nodes, kubeclipper will automatically add no schedule taint to the control nodes, and you can also make changes as needed.\nNode Labels: You can configure labels for added cluster nodes as needed.\nYou can configure the required nodes according to your business needs. If you need to create a non-highly available experimental cluster, you can also add only one control node, and remove the taint automatically added for the control node. For details, see \"Creating a Single-Node Experimental Cluster\".\nCluster configuration steps On the cluster configuration page, you can configure the cluster as follows:\nInstallation method and mirror repository:\nPage configuration Configure Package/Image Sources Online (public network environment)Mirror repository is empty Configuration package source: Download from kubeclipper.io.Image pull method: The image is pulled from the official image repository by default, such as k8s image pulled from k8s.gcr.io, calico pulled from docker.io. Online (public network environment)Mirror repository specification Configuration package source: Download from kubeclipper.io.Image pull method: Pull from the filled mirror repository. The components will inherit the repository address by default. Please ensure that the repository has the related component images. You can also set an independent mirror repository for a specific component, and the component image will be pulled from this address. Offline (intranet environment)Mirror repository is empty Configuration package source: Download from the local kubeclipper cluster server node, you can use the “kcctl resource list” command to check the available configuration packages, or use the “kcctl resource push” command to upload the required configuration packages.Image pull method: Download from the local kubeclipper cluster server node. CRI will import the image after downloading. You can use the “kcctl resource list” command to check the available image packages, or use the “kcctl resource push” command to upload the required image packages. Offline (intranet environment)Mirror repository specification Configuration package source: Download from the local kubeclipper cluster server node, you can use the “kcctl resource list” command to check the available configuration packages, or use the “kcctl resource push” command to upload the required configuration packages.Image pull method: Pull from the filled mirror repository. The components will inherit the repository address by default. Please ensure that the repository has the related component images. You can also set an independent mirror repository for a specific component, and the component image will be pulled from this address. kubeclipper provides the Docker Registry and uses the kcctl registry command for management. You can also use your own image repositories. K8S version: Specify the cluster K8S version. When you choose to install offline, you can choose from the K8S version of the configuration package in the current environment; when you choose to install online, you can choose from the officially recommended version of kubeclipper.\nETCD Data Dir: You can specify the ETCD data directory, the default is /var/lib/etcd.\nCertSANs: The IP address or domain name of the k8s cluster ca certificate signature, more than one can be filled in.\nContainer Runtime: According to the specified K8S version, the default container runtime is Docker for K8S version before v1.20.0, the default container runtime is Contianerd after v1.20.0; Docker is not supported after v1.24.0.\nContainer Runtime version: Specify the containerd/docker version. As with K8S, when you choose to install offline, you can choose from the version of the configuration package in the current environment; when you choose to install online, you can choose from the officially recommended version of kubeclipper.\nContainerd data Path: The \"root dir\" in the config.toml configuration can be filled in. The default is /var/lib/containerd.\nDocker data Path: The \"root dir\" in the daemon.json configuration can be filled in . The default is /var/lib/docker.\nContainerd image repository: The repository address where the containerd image is stored, the \"registry.mirrors\" in the config.toml configuration, more than one can be filled in.\nDocker image repository: The repository address where the Docker image is stored, the insecure registry in the daemon.json configuration, more than one can be filled in.\nDNS domain name: The domain name of the k8s cluster, the default is cluster.local.\nWorker load IP: Used for load balancing from worker nodes to multiple masters, a single master does not need to be set.\nExternal access IP: You can fill in a floating IP for user access, which can be empty.\nCNI configuration The current version kubeclipper only supports Calico as cluster CNI.\nCalico divides the pod CIDR set by users into several blocks (network segments), dynamically allocates them to the required nodes according to business requirements, and maintains the routing table of the cluster nodes through the bgp peer in the nodes.\nFor example: container address pool: 172.25.0.0/16, dynamically allocated network segment pool: 172.25.0.0 - 172.25.255.192 (172.25.0.0/26 i.e. 10 bits), the number of dynamically allocated network segments: 1023, the number of pods per network segment: 61 (193-254), the total number of pods is 1023 * 61 = 62403, the relative maximum number of nodes (according to the 200 service pod as the reference value): 312.\nClusters larger than 50 nodes are currently not recommended. Clusters larger than 50 nodes are recommended to manually configure route reflection to optimize the stability of routing table maintenance for nodes in the cluster.\nTo use Calico as the cluster CNI, you need the following configuration:\nCalico mode: 5 network modes are supported:\nOverlay-IPIP-All: Use IP-in-IP technology to open up the network of pods of different nodes. Usually, this method is used in the environment where the underlying platform is IaaS. Of course, if your underlying network environment is directly a physical device, it is also completely can be used, but the efficiency and flexibility will be greatly reduced. It should be noted that you need to confirm that the underlying network environment (underlay) supports the IPIP protocol. (The network method using overlay will have a certain impact on network performance). Overlay-Vxlan-All: Use IP-in-IP technology to open up the network of pods of different nodes. Usually, this method is used in the environment where the underlying platform is IaaS. Of course, if your underlying network environment is directly a physical device, it is also completely can be used, but the efficiency and flexibility will be greatly reduced. In theory, it can run on any network environment. Usually, we will use it when the underlying environment does not support the IPIP protocol. (The network method using overlay has a certain impact on network performance). BGP : Use IP-in-IP technology to open up the network of pods of different nodes. Usually this method is used in a bare metal environment. Of course, if the Iaas platform supports BGP, it can also be used. In this mode, the IP communication of pods is accomplished by exchanging routing tables among nodes in the cluster. If you need to manually open up the pod network between multiple clusters, you need to pay attention that the addresses you assign should not conflict. Overly-IPIP-Cross-Subnet: Use IP-in-IP technology to open up the network of pods of different nodes. Usually this method is used in the environment where the underlying platform is IaaS . It should be noted that you need to confirm the underlying network environment (underlay) supports the IPIP protocol. The difference with Overlay-IPIP-All is that if two upper Pods of different nodes in the same network segment communicate with each other through the routing table, the efficiency of upper Pods of different nodes in the same network segment can be improved. Overly-Vxlan-Cross-Subnet: The logic is similar to that of Overly-IPIP-Cross-Subnet. IP version: The IP version can be specified as IPV4 or IPV4 IPV6 dual stack.\nService subnet: Fill in the service subnet CIDR, v4 defaults to: 10.96.0.0/16, v6 defaults to fd03::/112, note that the Service network must not overlap with any host network.\nPod CIDR: Fill in the pod subnet CIDR, v4 default: 172.25.0.0/24, v6 default is fd05::/120, note that the Pod network must not overlap with any host network.\nThe bottom layer of the pod network:\nFirst-found (default): The program will traverse all valid IP addresses (local, loop back, docker bridge, etc. will be automatically excluded) according to ipfamily (v4 or v6). Usually, if it is a multi-network interface card, it will exclude the default gateway. The network interface card ip other than the gateway will be used as the routing address between nodes. Can-reach: Set the routing address between nodes by checking the reachability of the domain names or IP addresses. Interface: Get all network interface card device names that satisfy the regular expression and return the address of the first network interface card as the routing address between nodes. MTU: Configure the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the Calico environment. It is recommended to be no larger than 1440. The default is 1440. See https://docs.projectcalico.org/networking/mtu for details.\nStorage configuration The current version of Kubeclipper supports NFS as external storage types.\nConnect to NFS storage For NFS type external storage, you need to set the following:\nField Function description description/optional ServerAddr ServerAddr, the service address of NFS Required SharedPath SharedPath, the service mount path for NFS Required StorageClassName StorageClassName, the name of the storage class The default is nfs-sc, the name can be customized, and it cannot be repeated with other storage classes in the cluster ReclaimPolicy ReclaimPolicy, VPC recovery strategy Delete/Retain ArchiveOnDelete ArchiveOnDelete, whether to archive PVC after deletion Yes/No MountOptions MountOptions, the options parameter of NFS, such as nfsvers = 4.1 Optional, you can fill in several Replicas Replicas, number of NFS provisioners Default is 1 By default, multiple NFS storage types can be connected. Click the \"Continue to add\" button below to add another NFS storage. Note that the storage class name cannot be repeated.\nAfter setting up the external storage, the card below will show the storages you have enabled. You can choose a storage class as the default storage. For PVCs that do not specify a specific StorageClass, the default storage class will be used.\nCluster operation log view On the cluster details page, click the \"operation log\" tab to view the cluster operation log list. Click the \"View Log\" button on the right side of an operation log to view the detailed logs of all steps and nodes in the pop-up window. Click the step name on the left to view the detailed log output of the execution steps.\nDuring the execution of cluster operations, click View Log, you can view real-time log updates to trace the operation execution. For tasks that fail to execute, you can also view the log to find the execution steps and nodes marked with red dots, quickly locate errors, and troubleshoot the cause of operation failure.\nAccess cluster kubectl You can access the kubectl of the running cluster, click \"More\" \u003e \"Connect Terminal\" in the cluster operation, and you can execute the kubectl command line operation in the cluster kuebectl pop-up window.\nCluster plugin management In addition to installing plugins when creating a cluster, you can also install plugins for a running cluster. Taking the installation of storage plugins as an example, click the \"More\" \u003e \"Add Storage Item\" button in the cluster operation to enter the Add Storage Item page. You can install NFS plugins for the cluster. The installation configuration is the same as the configuration in cluster creation.\nFor installed plugins, you can view the plugin information on the cluster details page. You can click the \"Save as Template\" button in the upper right corner of the plugin card to save the plugin information as a template. You can also uninstall the cluster plugin by clicking the \"Remove\" button in the upper right corner of the plugin card.\nCluster node management On the \"Nodes\" list page of the cluster detail page, you can view the list of nodes in the current cluster, their specifications, status and role information.\nAdd cluster node When the cluster load is high, you can add nodes to the cluster to expand capacity. Adding nodes does not affect the running services.\nOn the cluster details page, under the Node List tab, click the \"Add Node\" button on the left, select the available nodes in the pop-up window, set the node labels, and click the \"OK\" button. The current version only supports adding worker nodes.\nRemove cluster node On the cluster details page, under the Node List tab, you can remove a node by clicking the \"Remove\" button on the right of the node. The current version only supports removing worker nodes.\nNote: To remove cluster nodes, you need to pay attention to security issues in production to avoid application interruptions.\nCluster version upgrade If the cluster version does not meet the requirements, you can upgrade the K8S version for the cluster. Similar to creating a cluster, you need to prepare the configuration package required for the cluster version and the K8S image of the target version and upload it to the specified location. For details, see \"Preparing to Create a Cluster\".\nClick the \"More\" \u003e \"Cluster Upgrade\" button of the cluster operation. In the cluster upgrade pop-up window, select the installation mode and mirror repository, and select the target version of the upgrade. The installation method of the upgrade and the configuration of the K8S version are the same as those of creating a cluster. For details, please refer to \"Cluster Configuration Guide\".\nCluster upgrades can be performed across minor versions, but upgrades skipped over later versions are not supported. For example, you can upgrade from v1.20.2 to v1.20.13, or from v1.20.x to v1.21.x, but not from v1.20.x to v1.22.x. For version 1.23.x, upgrading to version 1.24.x is not currently supported.\nThe cluster upgrade operation may take a long time. You can view the operation log on the cluster details page to track the cluster upgrade status.\nCluster Backup and Recovery The backup of K8S cluster by KubeClipper mainly backs up ETCD database data, and k8s resource object, such as namespaces, deployments, configMaps. The files and data generated by the resource itself are not backed up. For example, the data and files generated by the mysql pod will not be backed up. Similarly, the files under the PV object of the file class are not backed up, only the pv object is backed up. The backup function provided by KubeClipper is hot backup, which does not affect cluster usage during backup. While KubeClipper is not against backing up during the \"busy period\" of the cluster, it also strongly disapproves of backing up during the \"busy period\" of the cluster.\nCreate a backup point Before performing a backup, you need to set a backup point for the cluster, that is, set the storage location of the backup files. The storage type of the backup point can be FS storage or S3 storage . The following are node local storage , NFS storage and MINIO storage as examples:\nNode local storage (only for single-node experimental clusters): Create a storage directory. Connect to the cluster master node terminal (see Connect Nodes Terminal) and use the mkdir command to create the \"/root/backup\" directory in the master node.\nCreate a backup point. Click \"Cluster Management\" \u003e \"Backup Point\" to enter the backup point list page, click the \"Create\" button in the upper left corner, in the Create Backup Point pop-up window, enter \"Backup Point Name\", such as \"local\", select \"Storage Type\" as \"FS\", fill in \"Backup Path\", such as \"/root/backup\".\nSet up a cluster backup point. When creating a cluster, select \"Backup Point\" as \"local\" on the \"Cluster Configuration\" page, or edit an existing cluster and select \"local\" in the \"Backup Point\" pop-up.\nNote: Using a local node to store backup files does not require the introduction of external storage. The disadvantage is that if the local node is damaged, the backup files will also be lost, so it is strongly disapproved in a production environment .\nNFS： Prepare NFS storage. Prepare an NFS service and create a directory on the NFS server to store backup files, such as \"/data/kubeclipper/cluster-backups\".\nMount the storage directory. Connect the cluster master node terminal (see Connect node Terminal), use the mkdir command to create the \"/data/kubeclipper/cluster-backups\" directory in each master node, and mount it to the /data/kubeclipper/cluster-backups directory of the NFS server. Command example: mount -t nfs {NFS_IP}:/data/kubeclipper/cluster-backups /opt/kubeclipper/cluster-backups -o proto = tcp -o nolock.\nCreate a backup point. Click \"Cluster Management\" \u003e \"Backup Point\" to enter the backup point list page, click the \"Create\" button in the upper left corner, in the Create Backup Point pop-up window, enter \"Backup Point Name\", such as \"nfs\", select \"Storage Type\" as \"FS\", fill in \"Backup Path\" as \"/opt/kubeclipper/cluster-backups\".\nSet up a cluster backup point. When creating a cluster, select \"Backup Point\" as \"nfs\" on the \"Cluster Configuration\" page, or edit an existing cluster and select \"nfs\" in the \"Backup Point\" pop-up.\nMINIO： Prepare MINIO storage. Build MINIO services, refer to the official website https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html for the deployment process, or use existing MINIO services.\nCreate a backup point. Click \"Cluster Management\" \u003e \"Backup Point\" to enter the backup point list page, click the \"Create\" button in the upper left corner, in the Create Backup Point pop-up window, enter \"Backup Point Name\", such as \"minio\", select \"Storage Type\" as \"S3\", fill in \"bucket name\", such as \"kubeclipper-backups\", the bucket will be automatically created by kubeclipper, fill in the IP and port number of the MINIO storage service in the first step in \"Endpoint\", fill in the service username and password, click the \"OK\" button.\nSet up a cluster backup point. When creating a cluster, select \"backup point\" as \"minio\" on the \"Cluster Configuration\" page, or edit an existing cluster and select \"minio\" in the \"Backup Point\" pop-up.\nYou can view the list and details of all backup points on the \"Backup Points\" page of \"Cluster Management\" and do the following:\nEdit: Edit the backup point description, and the username/password of the S3 type backup point.\nDelete: Delete the backup point. If there are backup files under the backup point, deletion is not allowed.\nCluster backup You can back up your cluster ETCD data by clicking the \"More\" \u003e \"Cluster Backup\" button in the cluster operation.\nYou can view all backup files for the current cluster under the Backup tab on the cluster details page, and you can also perform the following operations for backups:\nEdit: Edit the backup description.\nRestore: Performs a cluster restore operation to restore the cluster to the specified backup state.\nDelete: Deletes the backup file.\nScheduled backup You can also create a timed backup for the cluster, click the \"More\" \u003e \"Scheduled Backup\" button in the cluster operation, in the timed backup pop-up window, enter the timed backup name, execution type ( repeat / only once) and execution time, and set the number of valid backups for repeated timed backups, and click the \"OK\" button.\nkubeClipper will perform backup tasks for the cluster at the execution time you set, and the backup file will be automatically named \"Cluster Name - Timed Backup Name - Random Code\". For repeated timed backups, when the number of backup files exceeds the number of valid backup files, kubeClipper will automatically delete the later backup files.\nAfter the scheduled backup is added, you can view the scheduled backup information on the \"Scheduled Backup\" tab of the cluster details page, and you can also view the backup files generated by the scheduled backup on the \"Backup\" tab.\nFor scheduled backup tasks, you can also perform the following operations:\nEdit: Edit the execution time of the scheduled backup task and the number of valid backups for repeated scheduled backups.\nEnable/Disable: Disabled scheduled backup tasks are temporarily stopped.\nDelete: Deletes a scheduled backup task.\nCluster Backup Restore If you perform restore operation while the cluster is running, KubeClipper will perform overlay recovery on the cluster, that is, backup the ETCD data in the file, overwriting the existing data .\nYou can click the \"Restore\" button on the right side of the backup under the Backup tab of the cluster details page; or click the \"More\" \u003e \"Restore Cluster\" button in the cluster operation, and select the backup to be restored in the Restore Cluster pop-up window. The current cluster can be restored to the specified backup state.\nNote: After the K8S version of the cluster is upgraded, it will no longer be possible to restore the backup to the pre-upgrade version.\n","categories":"","description":"A short lead description about this content page.

Click the node name to enter the node details page, you can view detailed node basic information and system information.\nThe node status in KubeClipper represents the management status of the node by kc-gent. Under normal circumstances, the node status is displayed as \"Ready\". When the node is out of contact for 4 minutes (within 10s of the error time), the status will be updated to \"Unknown\". Nodes with unknown status cannot perform any operations, nor can they create clusters or add/remove nodes for clusters.\nAdd node When deploying KubeClipper, you can add the initial server nodes which are used to deploy KubeClipper's own services, and agent nodes which are used to deploy K8S clusters. In a KubeClipper environment for experimentation or development, you can add a server node as an agent node at the same time. However, if it is used in a production environment, it is recommended not to reuse the server node as an agent node.\nYou can also use the kcctl join command to add agent nodes to KubeClipper, and mark a region for each agent node. The region can be a physical or logical location. You can use nodes in the same region to create a K8S cluster, but you cannot use nodes across regions to create a cluster. Nodes in unmarked regions belong to the default region. For details, see \"Kcctl Operation Guide\".\nCommand line example:\nkcctl join --agent beijing:1.2.3.4 --agent shanghai:2.3.4.5 Remove node When you no longer need some nodes, you can use the kcctl drain command to remove nodes from the platform. See \"Kcctl Operation Guide\" for details.\nCommand line example:\nkcctl drain --agent 192.168.10.19 Connect Terminal On the node list page, you can click the \"Connect Terminal\" button on the right side of the target node, enter the node port and username password information in the pop-up window, access the node SSH console and execute the command.\n","categories":"","description":"A short lead description about this content page.

Docker Registry 方案，并使用 kcctl registry 命令行进行管理，您也可以使用其他自有镜像仓库。 创建单节点实验集群 点击“集群管理”\u003e“集群”，进入集群列表页面，点击左上角“创建集群”按钮。\n进入创建集群向导页面的“节点配置”页面。填写“集群名称”，如“test”，不需选择“集群模版”。选择一个可用节点，添加为控制节点，并在污点管理列表中，将 master 节点的污点移除。点击“下一步”按钮。\n进入创建集群向导页面的“集群配置”页面。选择“离线安装”，“镜像仓库”不需填写，其他配置都可使用默认配置，点击“快速创建”按钮，跳转配置确认页面，点击“确认”按钮。\n单节点的实验集群创建完成，您可以在集群详情页查看集群详情，也可以点击“查看日志”按钮，查看集群创建过程中的实时日志。\n使用镜像仓库创建集群 如果创建的集群中包含较大的镜像，推荐您将所有镜像上传到特定的镜像仓库，创建集群会更快速更顺畅。\n添加镜像仓库。点击“集群管理”\u003e“镜像仓库”，进入镜像仓库列表页面，点击左上角“添加”按钮。在添加镜像仓库的弹窗中输入存放有镜像的仓库 IP 地址，点击“确定”按钮。\n创建集群。点击“集群管理”\u003e“集群”，进入集群列表页面，点击左上角“创建集群”按钮。按需配置集群节点，在“集群配置”页面的“镜像仓库”中，选择第一步添加的镜像仓库，根据需要完成集群其他配置后创建集群。\n使用集群模版创建集群 您可以使用集群模版，简化集群创建流程。\n添加模版。保存模版有两种方式，您可以在“集群管理”\u003e“模版管理”页面，添加集群模版，以备创建集群时使用。也可以点击集群操作中的“更多”\u003e“保存为模版”，将已存在的集群配置保存为模版，以便创建出和该集群同等配置的 K8S 集群。\n创建集群。点击“集群管理”\u003e“集群”，进入集群列表页面，点击左上角“创建集群”按钮，进入创建集群页面，填写“集群名称”，如“demo”，选择第一步中保存的集群模版，添加所需节点，点击右下角“快速创建”按钮，跳转至“配置确认”页面，核对模版信息无误后，点击“确认”按钮，创建集群。\n集群配置指南 节点配置步骤 在节点配置页面，您可以对节点进行以下配置：\n区域：集群所属区域，添加节点时可为节点指定物理的或逻辑的区域，使用该区域下节点创建的 K8S 集群也属于该区域，不支持使用跨区域的多个节点创建集群。\n控制节点：为集群指定奇数个的控制节点，生产环境一般使用3个控制节点以实现高可用。\n工作节点：根据业务规模，为新集群添加工作节点。\n污点管理：您可以为已添加的节点配置污点，kubeclipper 会自动为控制节点添加不允许调度（noschedule）的污点，您也可以根据需要进行更改。\n节点标签：您可以根据需要为已添加的集群节点配置标签。\n您可以按业务需要配置所需节点。如果需要创建非高可用的实验集群，也可以仅添加一个控制节点，并将控制节点自动添加的污点移除，详细操作参见“创建单节点实验集群”。\n集群配置步骤 在集群配置页面，您可以对集群进行以下配置：\n安装方式和镜像仓库： 页面配置 配置包/镜像来源 在线（公网环境）\n镜像仓库为空 1. 配置包来源：从 kubeclipper.io 下载。\n2. 镜像拉取方式：镜像默认从官方镜像仓库拉取，如k8s镜像从 k8s.gcr.io 拉取、calico 从 docker.io 拉取。 在线（公网环境）\n镜像仓库指定 1. 配置包来源：从 kubeclipper.io 下载。\n2. 镜像拉取方式：从填写的镜像仓库拉取，组件将默认继承该仓库地址，请确保该仓库存在相关组件镜像；组件也会提供独立的镜像仓库参数，设置后组件镜像从该地址拉取。 离线（内网环境）\n镜像仓库为空 1. 配置包来源：从本地 kubeclipper 集群server节点下载，您可以使用 kcctl resource list 命令查看本地可用配置包，或使用 kcctl resource push 命令上传所需配置包。\n2. 镜像拉取方式：从本地 kubeclipper 集群server节点下载，下载后由CRI进行镜像导入。您可以使用 kcctl resource list 命令查看本地可用镜像包，或使用 kcctl resource push 命令上传所需镜像包。 离线（内网环境）\n镜像仓库指定\n1. 配置包来源：从本地下载，您可以使用 kcctl resource list 命令查看本地可用配置包，或使用 kcctl resource push 命令上传所需配置包。\n2. 镜像拉取方式：从填写的镜像仓库拉取，组件将默认继承该仓库地址，请确保该仓库存在相关组件镜像；组件也会提供独立的镜像仓库参数，设置后组件镜像从该地址拉取。kubeclipper 提供 Docker Registry 方案，并使用 kcctl registry 命令行进行管理，您也可以使用其他自有镜像仓库。 K8S版本：指定集群K8S版本。当您选择离线安装的时候，可以从当前环境中配置包的K8S版本中选择；当您选择在线安装的时候，可以从 kubeclipper 官方推荐的版本中选择。\nETCD数据目录：可指定ETCD 数据目录，默认为/var/lib/etcd。\nCertSANs：k8s 集群 ca 证书签名的 ip 或者域名，可填写多个。\n容器运行时：根据指定 K8S 版本，K8S 版本在 v1.20.0 之前，容器运行时默认 docker，之后默认 containerd；v1.24.0 之后不支持 docker。\n容器运行时版本：指定containerd / docker版本。与 K8S 相同，当您选择离线安装的时候，可以从当前环境中配置包的版本中选择；当您选择在线安装的时候，可以从 kubeclipper 官方推荐的版本中选择。\nContainerd 数据目录：可填写config.toml 配置中的 root dir，默认为/var/lib/containerd。\nDocker数据目录：可填写daemon.json 配置中的 root dir，默认为/var/lib/docker。\nContainerd 镜像仓库：存放containerd镜像的仓库地址，config.toml 配置中的 registry.mirrors，可填写多个。\nDocker镜像仓库：存放docker镜像的仓库地址，daemon.json 配置中的 insecure registry,可填写多个。\nDNS 域名：k8s 集群的域名，默认为cluster.local。\nWorker 负载 IP：用于 worker 节点到多master的负载均衡，单一master不需要设置。\n外部访问IP：可以填写一个浮动 IP 给用户访问，可为空。\nCNI配置 当前版本仅支持Calico作为集群CNI。\nCalico将用户设置的pod cidr分为若干个block(网段)，根据业务需求动态的分配给需要的节点，并在节点中通过 bgp peer维护集群节点的路由表。\n例如：容器的地址池：172.25.0.0/16，动态分配的网段池: 172.25.0.0 - 172.25.255.192 (172.25.0.0/26 即 10 个比特位)，动态分配的网段数: 1023，每个网段的pod数量为: 61 (193-254)，总pod数量为1023 * 61 = 62403，相对最大节点数(按照200业务pod为基准值)：312。\n目前不建议大于50个节点的集群，大于50个节点的集群建议手动配置route reflection，用来优化集群中的节点的路由表维护的稳定性。\n使用Calico作为集群CNI，您需要进行以下配置：\nCalico 模式：支持5种网络模式：\nOverlay-IPIP-All: 使用 IP-in-IP 技术打通不同节点的 pod 的网络,通常这样的方式使用在底层平台是 iaas 的环境之中,当然如果你底层网路环境直接是物理设备的也完全可以使用只不过效率和灵活度都会大打折扣,需要注意的是你需要确认底层网络环境(underlay)是支持 IPIP 协议的.(使用overlay的网络方式对网络性能造成一定的影响)。\nOverlay-Vxlan-All: 使用 IP-in-IP 技术打通不同节点的 pod 的网络,通常这样的方式使用在底层平台是 iaas 的环境之中,当然如果你底层网路环境直接是物理设备的也完全可以使用只不过效率和灵活度都会大打折扣,他理论上可以在任何的网络环境上运行,通常在底层环境不支持 IPIP 协议的时候我们会使用他.(使用overlay的网络方式对网络性能造成一定的影响)。\nBGP: 使用 IP-in-IP 技术打通不同节点的 pod 的网络,通常这样的方式使用在裸机的环境上,当然底 Iaas 平台支持 BGP 的话也是可以使用的,这种模式下 pod 的 ip 通信是通过 集群中的各个节点中互相交换路由表来完成 pod 之间的通信的,如果你需要手动打通多个集群之间的 pod 网络需要注意你分配的地址断不应该有冲突。\nOveraly-IPIP-Cross-Subnet: 使用 IP-in-IP 技术打通不同节点的 pod 的网络,通常这样的方式使用在底层平台是 iaas 的环境之中,需要注意的是你需要确认底层网络环境(underlay)是支持 IPIP 协议的.和 Overlay-IPIP-All 的不同之处在于,如果 2 个不同节点但在同一个网段中的上 pod 互相通信时是通过路由表,这样可以提高在不同节点但在同一个网段中的上 pod 互相通信时的效率。\nOveraly-Vxlan-Cross-Subnet: 和 Overaly-IPIP-Cross-Subnet 逻辑相似不再做重复的解释。\nIP版本：可指定IP版本为IPV4或IPV4 IPV6双栈。\n服务子网：填写service子网CIDR，v4默认为：10.96.0.0/16，v6默认为fd03::/112，注意Service网络不得与任何主机网络重叠。\nPod CIDR：填写pod子网CIDR，v4默认：172.25.0.0/24，v6默认为fd05::/120，注意Pod 网络不得与任何主机网络重叠。\npod网路的底层：\nfirst-found（默认）：程序会根据ipfamily(v4或v6)遍历所有的有效的ip地址(local,loop back，docker bridge等会被自动排除)通常如果是多网卡时会排除默认网关以外的网卡的ip作为节点之间的路由地址。\ncan-reach：通过检查域名或者ip的可达性来设置节点之间的路由地址。\ninterface：根据正则表达式获取所有满足的网卡设备名称并返回第一个满足表达式网卡的地址作为节点之间的路由地址。\nMTU：为Calico环境配置最大传输单元(MTU)，建议不大于1440，默认为1440，详情见 Configure MTU to maximize network performance。\n存储配置 Kubeclipper当前版本内置了 NFS、Ceph 两种外接存储类型。\n对接NFS存储 对接NFS类型的外接存储，您需要设置以下内容：\n字段 作用说明 填写说明/可选项 服务地址 ServerAddr，NFS的服务地址 必填 共享路径 SharedPath，NFS的服务挂载路径 必填 存储类 StorageClassName，存储类的名称 默认为 nfs-sc，可自定义名称，不可与集群其他存储类重复 回收策略 ReclaimPolicy，VPC回收策略 删除 Delete / 保留 Retain 删除后归档 ArchiveOnDelete，是否在删除后归档PVC 是 / 否 挂载选项 MountOptions，NFS 的 options 参数，如nfsvers=4.1 选填，可填写多个 副本数 Replicas，NFS provisioner副本数 默认为1 NFS类型的存储默认可对接多个，点击下方“继续添加”按钮，可以添加多个NFS存储，注意存储类名称不可重复。\n设置完外接存储后，下方卡片会显示您已经开启的存储，您可以选择一个存储类作为默认存储，对于未指定特定StorageClass 的 PVC ，会直接使用默认的存储类。\n集群操作日志查看 在集群详情页面，点击“操作日志”标签页，可以查看集群操作日志列表。点击操作日志右侧“查看日志”按钮，可以在弹窗中查看全部步骤和节点的详细日志。点击左侧步骤名称，可查看执行步骤详细的日志输出。\n在集群操作执行过程中，点击查看日志，您可以实时查看到日志更新来跟踪操作执行情况。对于执行失败的任务，您也可以通过查看日志，找到红色圆点标注的执行步骤和节点，快速定位错误，排查操作失败原因。\n访问集群 kubectl 您可以访问运行中集群的 kubectl，点击集群操作中的“更多”\u003e“连接终端”，就可以在集群 kuebectl 弹窗中执行 kubectl 命令行操作。\n集群插件管理 除了在创建集群时安装插件，您也可以为运行中的集群安装存储和其他自定义插件。以安装存储插件为例，点击集群操作中的“更多”\u003e“添加存储项”按钮，进入添加存储项页面，可以为集群安装 NFS 或Ceph 类型的存储插件，安装配置与创建集群中的配置相同。\n对于已安装的插件，您可以在集群详情页查看插件信息。可以点击插件卡片右上角的“保存为模版”按钮，将插件信息保存为模版，以便为其他集群使用。也可以点击插件卡片右上角的“移除”按钮，卸载集群插件。\n集群节点管理 在集群详情页的“节点”列表页面，您可以查看当前集群中的节点列表，节点的规格、状态和角色信息。\n添加集群节点 当集群负载较高时，您可以通过为集群添加节点来达到主动扩容的目的，添加新的“节点”不会影响现有的业务的运行。\n在集群详情页的节点列表标签页下，点击左侧的“添加节点”按钮，在弹窗中选择可用节点，设置节点标签，点击“确认”按钮。当前版本仅支持添加工作节点。\n移除集群节点 在集群详情页的节点列表标签页下，您可以点击节点右侧的 “移除”按钮移除节点。当前版本仅支持移除工作节点。\n注意：移除集群节点，您需要注意生产中的安全问题，避免应用发生中断。\n集群版本升级 当集群版本不满足需要，您可以为集群升级 K8S 版本。与创建集群一样，您需要准备好集群版本所需配置包和目标版本的 K8S 镜像并上传至指定位置，详情参见“创建集群准备工作”。\n点击集群操作的“更多”\u003e“集群升级”按钮，在集群升级弹窗中选择安装方式和镜像仓库，选择升级的目标版本，升级的安装方式和 K8S 版本的配置与创建集群相同，详情参见“集群配置指南”。\n集群升级可以跨小版本，但不支持略过次版本的升级，如您可以从v1.20.2升级到v1.20.13，或由v1.20.x升级到v1.21.x，但不支持从v1.20.x升级到v1.22.x。对于1.23.x版本，暂不支持升级到1.24.x版本。\n升级集群操作可能需要较长时间，您可以在集群详情页面查看操作日志，跟踪集群升级状态。\n集群备份与恢复 KubeClipper 对 k8s 集群的备份主要为备份 ETCD 数据库数据，以及 k8s 的资源对象备份，如 namespace，deployment、configMap。对资源自身产生的文件和数据不做备份，例如对集群中运行的 mysql pod，该 mysql pod 产生的数据和文件，不会为之备份，同理，文件类的 pv 对象下的文件，也不做备份，仅仅备份 pv 这个对象。KubeClipper 提供的备份功能是热备份，备份期间不影响集群的使用。KubeClipper 虽然不反对在集群 “繁忙期” 备份，但也强烈不赞成在集群 “繁忙期” 备份。\n创建备份点 执行备份之前，您需要先为集群设置备份点，即设置备份文件的存储位置。备份点的存储类型可以是FS 存储或 S3 存储，下面以节点本地存储、NFS 存储和 MINIO 存储为例：\n节点本地存储**（仅适用单节点实验集群）：**\n创建存储目录。连接集群 master 节点终端（可参见连接节点终端），使用 mkdir 命令，在 master 节点中创建“/root/backup”目录。\n创建备份点。点击“集群管理”\u003e“备份点”，进入备份点列表页，点击右上角“创建”按钮，在创建备份点弹窗中，输入“备份点名称”，如“local”，选择“存储类型”为“FS”，填写“备份路径”，如“/root/backup”。\n设置集群备份点。创建集群时，在“集群配置”页面选择“备份点”为“local”，或者编辑已有集群，在编辑集群弹窗中的“备份点”中选择“local”。\n注意：使用本地节点存储备份文件，不需要引入外部存储，缺点是如果本地节点遭到破坏，备份文件也会丢失，所以强烈不赞成在生产环境中使用。\nNFS：\n准备 NFS 存储。准备一台 NFS 服务，并在 NFS 服务器上创建一个用于存放备份文件的目录，如 “/data/kubeclipper/cluster-backups”。\n挂载存储目录。连接集群 master 节点终端（可参见连接节点终端），使用 mkdir 命令，在每个 master 节点中创建“/data/kubeclipper/cluster-backups”目录，并 mount 到 NFS 服务器的 /data/kubeclipper/cluster-backups 目录即可，命令示例：mount -t nfs { NFS_IP }:/data/kubeclipper/cluster-backups /opt/kubeclipper/cluster-backups -o proto=tcp -o nolock。\n创建备份点。点击“集群管理”\u003e“备份点”，进入备份点列表页，点击右上角“创建”按钮，在创建备份点弹窗中，输入“备份点名称”，如“nfs”，选择“存储类型”为“FS”，填写“备份路径”为“/opt/kubeclipper/cluster-backups”。\n设置集群备份点。创建集群时，在“集群配置”页面选择“备份点”为“nfs”，或者编辑已有集群，在编辑集群弹窗中的“备份点”中选择“nfs”。\nMINIO：\n准备 MINIO 存储。搭建 MINIO 服务，部署过程参考官网 https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html，也可以使用已有 MINIO 服务。\n创建备份点。点击“集群管理”\u003e“备份点”，进入备份点列表页，点击右上角“创建”按钮，在创建备份点弹窗中，输入“备份点名称”，如“minio”，选择“存储类型”为“S3”，填写“bucket 名称”，如 “kubeclipper-backups”，该 bucket 将由 kubeclipper 自动创建，“Endpoint”中填写第一步 MINIO 存储服务的 ip 和端口号，填写服务用户名和密码，点击“确定”按钮。\n设置集群备份点。创建集群时，在“集群配置”页面选择“备份点”为“minio”，或者编辑已有集群，在编辑集群弹窗中的“备份点”中选择“minio”。\n您可以在“集群管理”的“备份点”页面查看所有备份点列表和详细信息，并执行以下操作：\n编辑：编辑备份点描述，和 S3 类型备份点的用户名/密码。\n删除：删除备份点，备份点下存在备份文件的，不允许删除。\n集群备份 您可以点击集群操作中的“更多”\u003e“集群备份”按钮，备份集群 ETCD 数据。\n您可以在集群详情页面的备份标签页下，查看当前集群的所有备份文件，还可以对备份执行以下操作：\n编辑：编辑备份描述。\n恢复：执行集群恢复操作，将集群恢复至指定备份状态。\n删除：删除指定备份文件。\n定时备份 您也可以为集群创建定时备份，点击集群操作中的“更多”\u003e“定时备份”按钮，在定时备份弹窗中，输入定时备份名称、执行类型（重复执行/仅执行一次）和执行时间，并为重复执行的定时备份设置有效备份个数，点击“确认”按钮。\nkubeClipper 会在您设置的执行时间为集群执行备份任务，备份文件会自动命名为“集群名称-定时备份名称-随机码”，对于重复执行的定时备份，kubeClipper 会在该定时任务下的备份文件超过有效备份个数时，自动删除超出个数的较晚的备份文件。\n定时备份添加完成后，可以在集群详情页的“定时备份”标签页查看定时备份信息，也可以在“备份”标签页查看定时备份产生的备份文件。\n对于定时备份任务，您还可以执行以下操作：\n编辑：编辑定时备份任务执行时间，和重复执行的定时备份的有效备份个数。\n启用/禁用：禁用的定时备份任务将暂时停止执行。\n删除：删除定时备份任务。\n集群备份恢复 如果您在集群正常运行期间执行恢复操作，则 KubeClipper 将对该集群进行覆盖式恢复，就是备份文件里面的 etcd 数据，覆盖现有的数据。\n您可以在集群详情页的备份标签页下，点击备份右侧的 “恢复”按钮；或点击集群操作中的“更多”\u003e“恢复集群”按钮，在恢复集群弹窗中选择需要恢复的备份，可以将当前集群恢复至指定备份状态。\n注意：集群升级后，将无法再恢复到升级前版本的备份。\n","categories":"","description":"KubeClipper 集群管理功能使用指南\n","excerpt":"KubeClipper

You can serve and link to generated reference docs created using Doxygen, Javadoc, or other doc generation tools by putting them in your static/ directory. Find out more in Adding static content. For OpenAPI reference, Docsy also provides a Swagger UI layout and shortcode that renders Swagger UI using any OpenAPI YAML or JSON file as source.\n","categories":"","description":"Low level reference docs for your project.\n","excerpt":"Low level reference docs for your project.\n","ref":"/en/docs/reference/","tags":"","title":"Reference"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"How to contribute to the kubeclipper\n","excerpt":"How to contribute to the kubeclipper\n","ref":"/docs/contribution-guidelines/","tags":"","title":"贡献指南"},{"body":" These basic sample guidelines assume that your Docsy site is deployed using Netlify and your files are stored in GitHub. You can use the guidelines “as is” or adapt them with your own instructions: for example, other deployment options, information about your doc project’s file structure, project-specific review guidelines, versioning guidelines, or any other information your users might find useful when updating your site. Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon’t forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\nWe use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\nFork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress. (Don’t add the Hugo property “draft = true” to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it’s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of “Deploy preview ready” to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers. Updating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\nClick Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes. Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\nFollow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\nFork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\nContinue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\nCreating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.
